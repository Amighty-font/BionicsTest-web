        <p>
          Amidst the increasing demand for bionic devices and UBCâ€™s strategic
          positioning in the field, our student-led <br /> design team, UBC
          Bionics, strives to foster excellence in bionics. Our ultimate goal is
          to create solutions that <br /> can replace human physiology, either
          by prosthesis or implants. UBC Bionics' current project is to design
          and <br /> build a smart bionic hand, GRASP, that can be used by
          individuals who have suffered amputation or congenital
          <br /> birth defects. Join us on our journey and be a part of our
          history! <br />

        <p>
          We are delighted to announce the recent addition of a brand new
          research team to the UBC Bionics Team. <br />
          This research team will collaborate on a collection of smaller group
          projects with UBC professors and <br /> graduate students, that will
          help members develop skills to aid to the advancement of our current
          project,
          <br />
          GRASP. For more details, view our FAQ section under the Join Us page!
